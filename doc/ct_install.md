## ct install

Install and test a chart

### Synopsis

Run 'helm install', 'helm test', and optionally 'helm upgrade' on

* changed charts (default)
* specific charts (--charts)
* all charts (--all)

in given chart directories. If upgrade (--upgrade) is true, then this
command will validate that 'helm test' passes for the following upgrade paths:

* previous chart revision => current chart version (if non-breaking SemVer change)
* current chart version => current chart version

Charts may have multiple custom values files matching the glob pattern
'*-values.yaml' in a directory named 'ci' in the root of the chart's
directory. The chart is installed and tested for each of these files.
If no custom values file is present, the chart is installed and
tested with defaults.

      --excluded-charts strings        Charts that should be skipped. May be specified multiple times

      --helm-repo-extra-args strings   Additional arguments for the 'helm repo add' command to be
                                       specified on a per-repo basis with an equals sign as delimiter
                                       (e.g. 'myrepo=--username test --password secret'). May be specified
                                       multiple times or separate values with commas
  -h, --help                           help for install
      --namespace string               Namespace to install the release(s) into. If not specified, each release will be

      --release-label string           The label to be used as a selector when inspecting resources created by charts.
                                       This is only used if namespace is specified (default "app.kubernetes.io/instance")
      --remote string                  The name of the Git remote used to identify changed charts (default "origin")
      --skip-missing-values            When --upgrade has been passed, this flag will skip testing CI values files from the
                                       previous chart revision if they have been deleted or renamed at the current chart

      --target-branch string           The name of the target branch used to identify changed charts (default "master")
      --upgrade                        Whether to test an in-place upgrade of each chart from its previous revision if the
                                       current version should not introduce a breaking change according to the SemVer spec
